# v2 Architecture (Breaking)

> Status: planned — being implemented across milestones [#21](https://github.com/mickeyzzc/onvif-go/issues/21)–[#25](https://github.com/mickeyzzc/onvif-go/issues/25), tracked by the [v2 epic](https://github.com/mickeyzzc/onvif-go/issues/20). This document is the plan of record.

v2 is a deliberately breaking release. Two forces drive it:

1. **Client-side scale**: ~24k lines behind a facade API that structurally required a single package, leaving the root directory flat.
2. **Server-side ambitions**: issues #15–#19 need `server/` to graduate from a test simulator into an embeddable device-side framework for real cameras (MiBee Eye / rpi3b-cam).

## Module versioning

Go modules require the `/v2` suffix for v2+: the module path becomes
`github.com/mickeyzzc/onvif-go/v2`. The v1 tags stay untouched for existing
consumers. Breaking within 1.x would forfeit semver credibility for a public
library — not an option.

## The knot v2 cuts: the Caller interface

v1 could not be split into packages because of an import cycle: the facade
accessors (`Client.Media()`) need the service types; the service methods need
`Client`. v2 applies the standard aws-sdk-go-v2 shape:

```go
// internal/api — tiny leaf package
type Caller interface {
    Call(ctx context.Context, endpoint, action string, request, response any) error
    EndpointFor(svc Service) string // resolved endpoint with device-endpoint fallback
}
```

- `Client` (root) implements `Caller` — the auth ladder, clock skew, and
  capability caching stay there.
- Each service package depends only on `internal/api`.
- The root imports the service packages and provides the accessors —
  one-directional, cycle-free.
- Services are **long-lived instances** created once by the client; accessors
  return the same pointer, so a service may hold its own state (the
  capabilities cache lives in `device.Service`).

## Server framework principles

- **Stateless services**: `server/services/*` hold no state; they translate
  SOAP operations into provider calls. All state decisions move behind
  interfaces.
- **Simulator as default**: the existing simulator behavior becomes
  `server/simulator`, selected when no provider is injected — `cmd/onvif-server`
  and the examples keep working unchanged.
- **Transport owns the cross-cutting concerns**: request context (#17),
  per-action authentication policy (#16), and byte-level XML control (#18) all
  live in `server/soap`, implemented once for every service.
- **Byte-predictable XML**: the response writer applies WSDL-canonical element
  casing, optional explicit namespace prefixes, and offers a raw-bytes channel
  for hosts that pre-build envelopes — locked by golden-fixture tests.

## Compatibility strategy

Breaking is allowed, but wasteful breaking is not:

- Root-package **type aliases** (`type Profile = media.Profile`) keep most
  consumer code compiling after the import-path swap.
- Facade call shapes stay: `client.Media().GetProfiles(ctx)`.
- What moves gets documented in `MIGRATION.md` with a complete mapping table
  (e.g. `onvif.SelectMainProfile` → `media.SelectMain`).
- Domain errors move with their packages (`media.ErrEmptyMediaURI`,
  `events.ErrEventsNotSupported`); cross-domain sentinels stay aliased in root.

## Milestones

| Stage | Issue | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | #21 | ✅ done — client package split, `/v2` path, aliases, zero behavior change |
| M2 | #22 | ✅ done — `server/soap` transport: context, auth policy, XML writer (#17 #16 #18) |
| M3 | #23 | ✅ provider interfaces + simulator extraction (#19) |
| M4 | #24 | device-side discovery responder + shared codec (#15) |
| M5 | #25 | docs, migration guide, CHANGELOG, `v2.0.0-rc1`, MiBeeNvr reference migration |

## Process rules

- Every change lands through a PR (main is locked: required checks, PR-only,
  enforced for admins, linear history).
- Each PR updates `docs/{en,zh}` and the CHANGELOG in the same change.
