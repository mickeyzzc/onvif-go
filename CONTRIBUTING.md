# Contributing to onvif-go

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document covers the workflow,
the quality bar, and what makes a good bug report for an ONVIF library.

## Workflow: pull requests only

The `main` branch is protected: all three CI jobs (lint, test, build) are
required status checks, **direct pushes are rejected — everything merges
through a pull request**, including changes by the maintainer.

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your change with tests
3. Ensure the full check suite passes locally:

```bash
make check   # lint + test
make fmt     # gofumpt + goimports via golangci-lint fmt — run before committing
```

4. Open a pull request; CI must be green before merge

Commit messages: imperative mood, first line ≤ 72 characters, reference
issues after the first line (`Fixes #123`).

Example:
```
Add GetAnalyticsConfiguration

- Implement the Analytics service facade
- Add mock-device tests
- Update media docs (en/zh)

Closes #123
```

## Quality bar

- **Zero lint findings.** `golangci-lint run` (v2) must report nothing;
  exemptions require a written rationale in `.golangci.yml`.
- **Formatting** is gofumpt + goimports (enforced by `make fmt` and checked
  in CI).
- **Tests**: behavioral tests run against `httptest` mock devices — see
  [docs/en/testing.md](docs/en/testing.md) for the layers and conventions.
  Real-camera tests are environment-gated and never run in CI.
- **Zero third-party dependencies** in the library module (stdlib only).
  This is a deliberate constraint; propose changes accordingly.
- Go 1.26; standard Go idioms, self-documenting names, comments where the
  code cannot speak for itself.

## Reporting bugs

Beyond the basics (reproduction steps, Go version, OS), the two things that
matter most for this library:

- **Camera model and firmware version** — ONVIF quirks are almost always
  firmware-specific.
- **Raw SOAP exchange** when possible — run `cmd/onvif-diagnostics` with
  `-capture-xml` (see [docs/en/cli.md](docs/en/cli.md)) and attach the
  output **after redacting credentials**. Captured responses can become
  `testdata/captures/` fixtures so the regression outlives the camera.

Never include real credentials in issues, examples, or test fixtures.

## Documentation

User-facing behavior changes should update the topic docs — both languages:
`docs/en/*.md` and its `docs/zh/*.md` mirror. API additions go into the
[README](README.md) quick-start only when they are primary-surface features,
and significant changes get a [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) entry.
